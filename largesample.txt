The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
A stitch in time saves nine, as they say
The early bird catches the worm, so they say
Too many cooks spoil the broth, or so I'm told
A penny saved is a penny earned, that's for sure
Birds of a feather flock together, ain't that the truth
The grass is always greener on the other side
Don't count your chickens before they hatch, wise words
Look before you leap, better safe than sorry
Rome wasn't built in a day, patience is key
When the cat's away, the mice will play
Better late than never, but never late is better
Two wrongs don't make a right, remember that
The pen is mightier than the sword, in most cases
Actions speak louder than words, so they say
All that glitters is not gold, appearances can deceive
Every cloud has a silver lining, keep looking up
Don't judge a book by its cover, wise advice
The squeaky wheel gets the grease, speak up
All's well that ends well, that's what matters
Haste makes waste, take your time and do it right
You can't teach an old dog new tricks, they say
A watched pot never boils, so be patient
Beggars can't be choosers, take what you can get
The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese
An apple a day keeps the doctor away, or so they say
Don't put all your eggs in one basket, diversify
The proof is in the pudding, results matter most
Where there's smoke, there's fire, trust your instincts
Better safe than sorry, err on the side of caution
Honesty is the best policy, always tell the truth
The squeaky wheel gets the grease, make some noise
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
If it ain't broke, don't fix it, leave well enough alone
A picture is worth a thousand words, show don't tell
There's no place like home, Dorothy said it best
Absence makes the heart grow fonder, distance can be good
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Don't bite the hand that feeds you, show some gratitude
The early bird catches the worm, rise and shine
A rolling stone gathers no moss, keep moving forward
Birds of a feather flock together, find your tribe
The squeaky wheel gets the grease, assert yourself
All that glitters is not gold, look beneath the surface
Don't put the cart before the horse, do things in order
The pen is mightier than the sword, use your words
A stitch in time saves nine, don't procrastinate
Too many cooks spoil the broth, don't micromanage
The grass is always greener on the other side
You can't judge a book by its cover, look deeper
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese
Don't count your chickens before they hatch, avoid assumptions
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
A watched pot never boils, patience is a virtue
The pen is mightier than the sword, in most cases
Don't cry over spilt milk, what's done is done
All's fair in love and war, or so they say
The squeaky wheel gets the grease, speak up for yourself
A leopard can't change its spots, people don't change easily
Where there's smoke, there's fire, there's usually some truth to rumors
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
The early bird catches the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese
Honesty is the best policy, even if it's difficult
The grass is always greener on the other side
Don't put all your eggs in one basket, diversify your investments
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
A penny saved is a penny earned, frugality pays off
Too many cooks spoil the broth, don't micromanage
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, like parent like child
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Haste makes waste, take your time and do it right
The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese
A stitch in time saves nine, don't procrastinate
The pen is mightier than the sword, choose your words carefully
Don't cry over spilt milk, move on from past mistakes
Where there's smoke, there's fire, trust your instincts
The proof is in the pudding, results are what matter
A watched pot never boils, be patient and give it time
Birds of a feather flock together, find like-minded people
The squeaky wheel gets the grease, make your needs known
All that glitters is not gold, don't be fooled by appearances
Don't bite the hand that feeds you, show gratitude and respect
The early bird catches the worm, get a head start on the day
A rolling stone gathers no moss, keep moving and growing
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
Don't put the cart before the horse, follow the proper order
The grass is always greener on the other side
You can't judge a book by its cover, get to know people
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
A leopard can't change its spots, accept people as they are
The pen is mightier than the sword, communication is key
Too many cooks spoil the broth, avoid overcrowding and confusion
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, children resemble their parents
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Haste makes waste, do things carefully and methodically
The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese
A stitch in time saves nine, take care of problems promptly
